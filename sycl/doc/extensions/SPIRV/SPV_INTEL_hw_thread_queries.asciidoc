== Status

Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to a
feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this
specification may be released as a formal extension.


Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are
subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software
products. If you are interested in using this feature in your software product,
please let us know!

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification,
Version 1.5 Revision 5.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

== Overview

The extension adds BuiltIn Decorations to query maximum number of H/W thread IDs per sub-device, sub-device ID and H/W thread ID within the sub-device. These instructions combined can be used to
calculate unique H/W thread ID which is executing the code.


== Extension Name


To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the appropriate *OpExtension* must
be present in the module:

[subs="attributes"]
----
OpExtension "{extension_name}"
----

== New Capabilities

This extension introduces new capabilities:

[subs="attributes"]
----
{capability_name}
----

== New BuiltIn Decorations

BuiltIn Decorations added under the *{capability_name}* capability:

----

SubDeviceIDINTEL
HWThreadIDINTEL
MaxHWThreadIDPerSubDeviceINTEL

----

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.5


=== Capabilities

Modify Section 3.31, Capability, adding rows to the Capability table:

--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| Capability ^| Implicitly Declares 
| {capability_token} | *{capability_name}*
| Reserved. +
 +
See also extension: *{extension_name}*
|====
--

=== Decorations

Modify Section 3.20, Decoration, adding <<Literal>> _BuiltIn parameter_ to <<Extra Operands>> of *BuiltIn* decoration.

Modify Section 3.21, BuiltIn, adding these rows to the BuiltIn table:

==== 3.21 BuiltIn

--
[options="header"]
|====
2+^| BuiltIn 2+^| Enabling Capabilities
| {SubDeviceIDINTEL_token} | [[SubDeviceIDINTEL]]*SubDeviceIDINTEL* +
 ID of the sub-device on which the code running in *Kernel* +
<<Execution Model,Execution Model>>. The BuiltIn decoration takes additional _Literal_ +
 *Affinity* parameter, see the client API specification for more detail. +
2+| *{capability_name}*
| {HWThreadIDINTEL_token} | [[HWThreadIDINTEL]]*HWThreadIDINTEL* +
 ID of the H/W thread within a sub-device on which the code running in *Kernel* +
<<Execution Model,Execution Model>>. See the client API specification for more detail. +
2+| *{capability_name}*
| {MaxHWThreadIDPerSubDeviceINTEL_token} | [[MaxHWThreadIDPerSubDeviceINTEL]]*MaxHWThreadIDPerSubDeviceINTEL* +
 Maximum number of H/W thread ID per sub-device in *Kernel* <<Execution Model,Execution Model>>. See +
 the client API specification for more detail. +
